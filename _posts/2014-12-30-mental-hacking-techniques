1. Using the WWID (What would (role-model) do?) technique.  I found that this technique has an uncanny ability to snap out of mental delusions/confusion and follow a very clear, straightforward path of action.

2. "Is what I am doing right now productive to my life?" technique: Pretty straightforward, asking myself this often helps to realize I am wasting my time in many situations such as surfing the internet mindlessly.

3. Stepping Outside My Body and Observing Myself Through the Third Person technique:  As described this technique theoretically allows me to see myself and my actions from a more objective standpoint.  I just came up with this recently, so it is yet untested.
