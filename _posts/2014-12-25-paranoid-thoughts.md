I have been having paranoid worries once again.  While I am sure most of it is paranoia, the negative effect it has on me is real.  I must avoid sources of paranoia at all costs. I also recognize that I am more prone to paranoia post fping.

I have been reading 'Emotional Intelligence' which includes a section on dealing with worries and paranoia.  It said that worries work as a sort of mental amulet to magically prevent bad things from happening by the act of worrying.  This gave me insight into how and why worries work.  The truth is my worries do not produce productive solutions.  Instead they begin a spiral of paranoia, fear, bad mood and short temper towards those close to me. I must learn to surpress my paranoid fears.  

Also, I no longer see the necessity of pretending to be friends with some people in my life.  The sad fact is this, if after all these years I still don't feel 100% comfortable and at ease around them, sorry but they are not my friends and I must move on.  A goal for this year is not waste any time at all with untrue friends.
