Went to volunteer at the ny center today.  While I was there, I took notice to M's behavior and social effects on people around him.  M is a good kid, he reminds me of myself.  I noticed like myself, he lacks in social calibration, and doesn't notice how his behavior influence those around him.  His voice also sounds similar to mine. I suspect that like M, I often come off as goofy and socially uncalibrated.

One important thing to note was that we were waiting in line at Dunkin Donuts and he cut all the way up to front loudly saying 'Sorry, sorry, just want to see what's on the menu'.  This prompted some of the people in line to give each other strange looks like: 'What's with this guy?' When we were about to order, he also suddenly said 'Here, you guys go ahead' all of a sudden, which to us seemed strange and awkward.

I believe that in his own mind he was trying to be accomodating to other people, but had the opposite effect, instead making him standout and seem bizarre.  I should take note not to be 'overly accomodating' to strangers when it is not necessary.  

I believe M will serve as a good reference point for myself, as we both share social skill problems, which will allow me to gain insight into how I am perceived by others.

I should also note to him when I can, in a non-offending way, so he can improve himself as well.  This will be tricky to do.


Also, at Dunkin Donuts, I had a conversation with P about krufu.  He gave me advice to chant to draw people into your life that are seeking the practice.
