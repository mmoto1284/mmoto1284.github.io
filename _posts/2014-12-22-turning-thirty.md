Welp, finally turned 30.  Looking back on this past decade, I feel that a lot of time was wasted working an unsatisfactory job and distracting myself with harmful partying that brought no happiness, and wasting time getting angry at, worrying about, or feeling resentment towards shitty friendships.

For the next decade, I want to focus on constructive use of time, mind/thought-space, and energy.  No more getting angry at something a shitty friend or random stranger said to me or the way they looked at me.  No more pursuing inefficient and useless methods of game.  

Instead I will study and gain better insight into how my brain works (currently reading Emotional Intelligence which is shedding light on this).

I will learn to hack my brain into getting the results I want.  

I was at the gym today and noticed that the same old pattern of freezing up and sending furtive glances as an attractive set is absolutely useless to me and obv never yields results.  

I will work on overcoming my brains ineffective habits when encountering attractive sets (and other challenges), and how I can use my brain to push myself towards actions that actually produce results.

All in all, I want to stop fucking wasting time in my 30s.  I did enough of that in my teens and twenties.  Fuck that noise.
