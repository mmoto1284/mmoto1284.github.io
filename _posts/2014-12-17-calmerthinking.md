I realized I left my card at the fc bar the other night.  In my panic I thought that the extra charges on my card were fraudulent by the bar staff.  Turns out it was a mistake and the two other charges were unrelated to the bar.  

I also looked more into nootropics.  I hope that I will find a good stack that will allow me to become more clear minded, focused and generally operate better.

Learned lesson: In panicked situations is when you should be most calm and careful, before jumping to conclusions. You do not yet have good control over your mind.
