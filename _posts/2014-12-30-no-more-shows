So I went to another EDM show last night.  As predicted I didn't have a good time at all and found myself losing myself to the world of animality even though I determined I would resist it before going.  At least this much is now clear, I simply do not enjoy the shows, and I don't think I really belong in the scene.  

One good thing is that I may have figured out a way to surpress the hunger/animality, just set a clear restriction in your mind, and then just stick with it.  You will feel better for it.
