Today I was pondering about how I could increase my intelligence. I have noticed that my mind has slowed throughout the years possibly due to damage from stress, injuries, M, martial arts, etc.  My mind is clearly lacking in some areas, including memory, navigation, and notably social intelligence.  A key ingrediant I am lacking in social intelligence, is emotion.  When I say things genuinely out of emotion, I am received well by listeners. When I blabber just to say something, I sound very stupid and am not received well.  

- I need to feel emotion to communicate effectively. 

I had the realization that I am nothing more than bio-hardware, no different than a computer.  Now as I reach 30 my hardware is beginning to slow, but I can still sharpen it and practice it everyday so that my mind can become even sharper and more efficient than in my youth (which shouldn't be too hard as my thoughts were constantly distracted then.)  


 - I am nothing but hardware.  


Also, went shopping for a jacket.  Ran into a beautiful woman, had one of those moments of beauty.  I chickened out.  I need to remember that I can die at any moment.  Even if I did approach I probably would have mucked it up, more the reason to have done it to increase my overall chances.  I also realized I am really not into younger girls now (under 25).  They seem very immature and annoying.  I should focus on real women. 

- Life can end at any moment, none of it matters any way.

I also realized that I should not stress about outcomes for my goals. The more I stress, the more I am likely to fail. Remember that everything is insignificant anyway.  Instead just exert the most effort you can, without being attached emotionally at all to the outcome. 

- Not trying, but trying you hardest.
